# Logic Gates

## What are they?

Logic gates are the basic building blocks for everything that has to do with logic in a computer.

## What do they do?

They take one or two boolean values as input and output one boolean value.

> A boolean value is a true or a false. It is often respectively represented with 1 and 0.

```
true = 1
false = 0
```

## AND gate

The AND gate takes two inputs and outputs one only if both inputs are ones.

```
# & is the AND gate operator

1 & 1 = 1
0 & 1 = 0
1 & 0 = 0
0 & 0 = 0
```

## OR gate

The OR gate takes two inputs and outputs one if either of the inputs is one.

```
# | is the OR gate operator

1 | 1 = 1
0 | 1 = 1
1 | 0 = 1
0 | 0 = 0
```

## XOR gate

The XOR gate (exclusive OR gate) takes two inputs and outputs one only if one of its inputs is one.

```
# ^ is the XOR gate operator

1 ^ 1 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
0 ^ 0 = 0
```

## NOT gate

The NOT gate takes a single input and outputs one when the input value is zero. Otherwise, it outputs one.

```
# ~ is the NOT gate operator

~1 = 0
~0 = 1
```

> The AND, OR, and XOR gates are binary operators, meaning they take two inputs. NOT is a unary operator because it only takes one input value.

Great, you now understand all the logic gates in a computer. Think about them and see how you can create a summation logic gate circuit with them.
