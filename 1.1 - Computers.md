## What is a computer?

A computer is a machine capable of storing data and performing calculations with it. In other words, your digital watch, the calculator of yours you use in your math class, and many other things around you are computers.

## How do modern computers work?

All modern computers use electricity and magnetism to store information and perform calculations on it. I will not go into details because this is beyond my field of knowledge.
