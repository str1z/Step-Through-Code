# Turing Machines

## What are they?

They are machines that are capable of performing any calculation given a table of basic rules and instructions.

Turing machines are at the core of all the other machine models of this chapter.

Imagine you have a tape of colors. Each color represents a different instruction. With identical instructions, colors, you can rearrange the colors to perform various actions.  

The machine code that we wrote in the last section was the table, and the labels ABC were the colors. We had a table of instructions with only three instructions. It means that we have created a Turing machine in the previous section. 

However, it was not a real Turing machine because we did not have enough instruction to do other actions; we could only increment the x variable. If we had a larger instruction table, we could have performed various algorithms making it a Turing machine.
