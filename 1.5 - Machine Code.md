# Machine Code

## What is code?

A code is a language where things are not explicitly defined.
In other words, I would call it:

> Language for machines where things are not explicitly defined for humans because they do not understand it.

## Our machine code

```
let x and y be 0

machine code A: set y to 1
machine code B: increase x by y
machine code C: jump back to the previous instruction
```

## Our program with our machine code

```
A
B
C
```

This program will loop forever and never stop.

-   We set the variable y to one.
-   The variable x will increase by y each time we execute instruction B.
-   Once running instruction C, we will jump back to the previous instruction, which is instruction B.

This program will increase x forever.
