# Binary Numbers

## The human counting system
Humans use a counting system of base-10. It means that we have ten digits.
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

From a mathematical standpoint, the following will represent the number 7473.

The above is not easy to read and very hard to write. We will use programming math grammar.

```
7 * 10**3 + 
4 * 10**2 + 
7 * 10**1 +
3 * 10**0 = 7473

7 * 1000 + 
4 * 100 + 
7 * 10 +
3 * 1 = 7473

7000 + 400 + 70 + 3 = 7473

So base-10 7473 in base-10 is 7473
```

> `*` is the multiplication operator
> `**` is the power operator. 

## The nowadays computer counting system
Computers use a counting of base-2 because electricity can only represent two different states: open and closed circuits.

Open is zero, and closed is one.

This counting system is called binary.

> Little confused?
> In your electricity and magnetism class, you learned that there is no current when the circuit is open, and a current can pass if it is closed. 

Here is the math behind the base-2 counting system. In this example, we are trying to write the base-10 number 13 in base-2.
```
1 * 2**3 + 
1 * 2**2 +
0 * 2**1 +
1 * 2**0 = 13

1 * 8 + 
1 * 4 +
0 * 2 +
1 * 1 = 13

8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13

So base-10 13 in base-2 is 1101
```
